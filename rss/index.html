If not then just ignore it, it isn&apos;t necessary. The heart of any blog is it&apos;s content not the design :) &#xA0;</p><hr><h2 id="step-3-wget">Step 3: WGET</h2><p>Here&apos;s the thing. We&apos;re going to host our website on GitHub for free. GitHub only allows us to host a <strong><em>static</em> website</strong> i.e no backend features. What do we mean by that? Try using the search button on this website, it won&apos;t work because it&apos;s a non static feature. It&apos;s nonetheless there because it would work when you host it on Ghost.org let&apos;s say (but you&apos;ll have to pay the yearly fee).</p><p>Static features are all you require as a student for a blog. At the end of the blog I&apos;ve added the method to make a dynamic website for free as well, but I&apos;d suggest you going for it if you&apos;re comfortable with static first.</p><p>GitHub websites should be made of .html files, whereas our themes are .hbs files.<br>An <strong>HBS file</strong> is <strong>a </strong>template file created by Handlebars, a web template system. It contains a template written in HTML code and embedded with Handlebars expressions. An HBS file performs the same function as a .HANDLEBARS file. We need to convert these into .html files before we can deploy them on GitHub. </p><p><strong>Wget = Web Get</strong>. It crawls the websites and gets the HTML files we need for our GitHub page. <br><em>Download wget by following these instructions</em>: <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wget-command-with-examples"><strong>How to Use wget Command With Examples | PhoenixNAP KB</strong></a><br>Now, <br>1) Go to the Joelma/(your theme name folder) inside your editor and make a new folder inside it called <strong><em>docs</em></strong>. (very important)<br>2) Using your editor, open the terminal <strong>INSIDE THE JOELMA</strong>/<strong>(your theme)</strong> FOLDER. <br>Not inside docs. Not in C: drive. We need a terminal inside the theme folder and then enter the following command </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>wget -r -nH -P docs -E -T 2 -np -k <em>(your localhost URL)</em></p>

Like I&apos;ll have to do after I complete writing this. So what I personally suggest is you <strong>get familiar with github</strong> instead of copy pasting the commands every time, because it gets messy at times. You just need to learn the basics of <em>add, commit, push, log, status, pull and branch.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/03/Untitled-picture.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to make a blog for yourself for free!" loading="lazy"><figcaption>How basic Git commands are used</figcaption></figure><p>Here are some great resources to learn Git &amp; GitHub: <br><em>Youtube CodeWithHarry playlist</em>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evknSAkUIvs&amp;list=PLu0W_9lII9agwhy658ZPA0MTStKUJTWPi"><strong>What is Git/GitHub &amp; Why do we need it? | Git Tutorials #1 - YouTube</strong></a><br><em>GitHub documentation</em>: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started"><strong>Getting started with GitHub - GitHub Docs</strong></a><br><em>Basics of GitHub by MDN</em>: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/GitHub_beginners"><strong>GitHub for complete beginners - The MDN project | MDN (mozilla.org)</strong></a><br><em>Atlassian Git guide</em>: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials"><strong>Git Tutorials and Training | Atlassian Git Tutorial</strong></a></p><p>For those of you familiar with Git and GitHub already you know how it goes:<br><strong>clone,</strong> <strong>add, commit, push</strong>.<br>Also, don&apos;t forget to <strong>delete the default READ.ME file</strong> from your directory. </p><hr><h2 id="step-5-the-last-finally">Step 5: The Last (finally) </h2><p>We&apos;ve to get the <br>SSL certificate : An SSL certificate is <strong>a digital certificate that authenticates a website&apos;s identity and enables an encrypted connection</strong><br>DNS : <strong>special Domain Name System</strong> (DNS) record that allows domain owners to specify who is allowed to issue SSL certificates for their domains<br>And then move our websites to https so it&apos;s all safe and secure.</p><p>I would&apos;ve loved to explain this but GitHub has done it and I can&apos;t do it better so <br><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https"><strong>Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS - GitHub Docs</strong></a> - Read this.<br>It&apos;s a small but important step, and with this your website is ready to roll! </p><hr><h2 id="step-6-editing-and-adding-new-posts">Step 6: Editing and adding New Posts</h2><p>Technically not a step but eh.

This change starts with a simple step, which, when done repeatedly, becomes a habit. So what is the best practice to cultivate to change our lives?</p><p>Brendon Burchard has been a high-performance coach for over a decade, and after a study in over 190 countries, he says<br><em>&quot;</em><strong><em>Hands down, the habit that changed their trajectory was seeking clarity.</em></strong><em>&quot;</em> <br><em>Reference:</em> &#xA0;<a href="https://brendon.com/blog/high-performancehabits/"><em>High performance habits</em></a>.</p><p>Seeking clarity is a habit? Yes, it is and here&apos;s why it&apos;s the most important habit. Clarity on the big questions of life is nothing short of a superpower. We have limited time and energy, and clarity helps you channel them both to that one thing that truly matters to you. If you fail to finish what you start, if you seek everyone&apos;s validation for everything, and if you can&apos;t say no to the things and people draining the life out of you, this is what you&apos;re missing.</p><p>People in the top 1% of their job category are always the people with clarity. If you ask them what five words best describe them, they&apos;ll fire it at you instantly. What are their values? Instant answers. When Opera Winfrey walks into a room for a meeting, her first question is, <em>&quot;What&apos;s our intention today?&quot;.</em></p><blockquote><em><strong>&quot;Clarity precedes success.&quot; ~ Robin Sharma.</strong> </em></blockquote><hr><h3 id="why-even-bother">WHY EVEN BOTHER? </h3><ol><li>We want people to understand us more than anything else. If we know who we are, we can connect with people better. If we can&apos;t understand ourselves, how can we expect others to? <strong><em>Know yourself</em></strong></li><li>Pareto&apos;s principle says: 80% of all your wealth, happiness or any desirable outcome depends on 20% of your input. Finding that 20% and channelizing our efforts towards it is the most crucial step of specialization. <strong><em>Find your 20.</em></strong></li><li>Life is just a series of choices. Every different choice leads to a different life. If you define your values as clear as water, all your preferences will be aligned. <em><strong>Clarity gives you the direction</strong></em> without which practising the wrong things would make you perfect at them. </li><li>Jay Shetty explains how you&apos;re stressed when your mind is not aligned with your actions. You still do it when you&apos;re doing something, but you&apos;re unsure if it&apos;s right or when you hate your job or education. A clear image of what you want from your life in the next week or the next decade helps you align your actions with your thoughts. <strong><em>Eliminate stress</em></strong><em>.</em></li><li>Most importantly, it gives you the strength to stand alone. When you dare to differ, you&apos;re going to doubt yourself every day when you see everyone else taking the other road. When you walk on a path where others don&apos;t, you need to know where you&apos;re going. <em><strong>Seek clarity.</strong></em></li></ol><h3 id="okay-so-how-does-it-work">OKAY, SO HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3><p>The Bible and One republic (in the song counting stars) say, <em>&quot;seek it out, and ye shall find&quot;, </em>and it is as simple as that.</p><p>We see ads every day on social media, on roads and almost everywhere. But can you recall the ads you see? We browse through Facebook to get updates on our friends and family, so we blur out whatever isn&apos;t about them. But remember that time when you were thinking of getting a new pair of shoes or headphones, and an ad shows up right on your feed, and you can&apos;t help but notice? Even when you&apos;re not looking for it, your brain&apos;s subconscious clarity on what you want makes you see that ad. When you define a crystal clear image of what you want from your life, even shortly, everything else blurs.</p><p>We&apos;ve heard about the law of attraction, believing that positive thoughts attract positive things and people in life. But maybe we all have positive and negative things around us all the time, and only when we have the clarity of what we want and choose to focus on the positive do we stop seeing the negatives and see the positives everywhere!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/10/IE-clarity-simplicity-same-cover.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Foundation of Success." loading="lazy"></figure><hr><h3 id="how-do-i-seek-clarity-like-the-pros">HOW DO I SEEK CLARITY LIKE THE PROS? </h3><p>Seeking clarity is an active process that requires you to put in the time to get the return. A high performer spends 74 more mins a week deliberately seeking clarity on different aspects of life than an average person. </p><p>You can go wrong while seeking clarity when you emphasize too much on the answers. <strong>Be obsessed with finding the right questions</strong>. When you have the right questions, you&apos;ll find the answers eventually. Clarity starts with the right questions.<br>Set apart some time daily or weekly to reflect on the work you do, how you interact with people, the good and bad habits, document everything. Write it down or record voice notes. <strong>Study yourself</strong> like you would study someone before hiring them.</p><p>Ask yourself :<br>1. Who am I? What are my strengths and weaknesses<br>2. What are my values in life?<br>3. What are my future aspirations? What everyday things that I do are steps towards it?<br>4. If I could describe my ideal self in the future, the person I&apos;m trying to become, how would I describe them? &#xA0;<br>5. Am I of service to people?</p><p>Questions like my future aspirations and what I want with life can be intimidating at first. Take small steps, list the things you like, the things you&apos;re good at, the items you want to be good at. Find an intersection; no matter how absurd it sounds, it&apos;s possible; it&apos;s the 21st century. Ignore the naysayers.</p><p>You can go as deep with the questions as your mind goes, and there&apos;s no right or wrong. It can be scary because you&apos;re going to be vulnerable, you&apos;re going to have the same experience you had when it was time to raise your hand in class to ask a doubt, but we know it&apos;s the only way to learn. The only thing to be scared of is ending up somewhere wrong because we were too busy or afraid to ask.</p><blockquote><strong>Clear thinking requires courage rather than intelligence. ~ Thomas Szasz</strong></blockquote><p>Ask yourself questions about the four essential aspects of life: <strong>Self, Social, Skill and Service</strong>. The 4-S of clarity.</p><p>Don&apos;t worry about getting all four perfectly at once. Every one of us has at least one of the four aspects under control, making it easier to have clarity. One by one, we put all four pieces together.</p><p>Remember that nowhere does it say the habit is getting clarity because getting to the end of it is not the goal; just actively seeking it does the work. It&apos;s about progress, not perfection. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/10/1_cDBKxgRD30TjEgDe0g877A.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="The Foundation of Success." loading="lazy" width="570" height="379"></figure><hr><h3 id="the-warren-buffet-way">THE WARREN BUFFET WAY</h3><p>Take a notebook and list down 25 of the most important things you value in your life. Done? Now make sure you rank them in the order of importance. Then finally, scrape off the bottom 20 from the list. Yes, remove them from the list and your life at once. <br><br><strong>You have to realize that the bottom 20 are draining your energy and time that you need to assign to the top 5 essential things in your life</strong>. These 20, although important, aren&apos;t important enough. That&apos;s why they&apos;re below the top 5. Things like social media have a bad reputation already. Anyone who wastes time on social media knows they are wasting their time. But these sneaky 20 things give you a sense of false productivity because they are essential. Still, they&apos;re taking away time from the top 5 things that could revolutionize your life, which is why they&apos;re so dangerous. <br></p><h3 id="take-action-now">TAKE ACTION NOW.</h3><p>Just thinking never works.

Get familiar with yourself. This is not a motivational youtube video that fires you up for a day and then long lost forever. </p><blockquote><strong>You can&apos;t be what you can&apos;t see. ~ Marian Wright Edelman</strong></blockquote><h3 id="the-biggest-enemies-to-clarity">THE BIGGEST ENEMIES TO CLARITY</h3><p><strong>Asking the wrong questions can lead down the wrong path</strong>. Why don&apos;t I fit in? Why don&apos;t I have what he has? Why do I suck? What&apos;s wrong with me? These are the questions that make things worse. Avoid them.</p><p>&quot;I like being spontaneous&quot; is an excuse you might want to give yourself. But the ability to think and foresee is what makes us human. A balance of spontaneity and clarity makes life better.</p><p>You&apos;re never too busy for yourself. If you can&apos;t take out 60 mins in a week for navigating your ship of life to the direction you want to go in, you&apos;ll always be pushed around by the currents. You&apos;ve made it to the end of the post, so I&apos;m sure you will be a true seeker.</p><blockquote><strong>If you don&apos;t have time for the small things, you won&apos;t have time for the big things. ~Sir Richard Branson</strong></blockquote><p><em>Thanks for reading :)</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

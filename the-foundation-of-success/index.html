This change starts with a simple step, which when done repeatedly, becomes a habit.  So what is the best habit to cultivate to change our lives?</p><p>Brendon Burchard has been a high-performance coach for over a decade and after a study in over 190 countries, he says<br><em>"<strong>Hands down the habit that really changed their trajectory was seeking clarity</strong>"</em> <br><em>Reference:</em>  <em><a href="https://brendon.com/blog/high-performancehabits/">High performance habits</a></em>.</p><p>Seeking clarity is a habit? Yes, it is and here's why it's the most important habit. Clarity on the big questions of life is nothing short of a superpower.  We have limited time and energy, and clarity helps you channel them both to that one thing that truly matters to you. If you fail to start what you finish if you seek everyone's validation for everything and if you can't say no to the things and people draining the life out of you, this is what you're missing.</p><p>People in the top 1% of their job category are always the people with clarity. If you ask them what 5 words describe them the best they'll fire it at you instantly. What are their values? Instant answers. When Opera Winfrey walks into a room for a meeting her first question is <em>"What's our intention today?".</em></p><blockquote><em><strong>"Clarity precedes success." ~ Robin Sharma.</strong> </em></blockquote><hr><h3 id="why-even-bother">WHY EVEN BOTHER? </h3><ol><li>We want people to understand us more than anything else. If we know who we are we can connect with people better. If we can't understand our own self how can we expect others to? <strong><em>Know yourself</em></strong></li><li>Pareto's principle says: 80% of all your wealth, happiness or any desirable outcome depends on 20% of your input. Finding that 20% and channelizing our efforts towards it is the most important step of specialisation.<strong> <em>Find your 20.</em></strong></li><li>Life is just a series of choices. Every different choice leads to a different life. If you define your values clear as water, all your choices will be aligned.<em><strong> Clarity gives you the direction</strong></em> without which practising the wrong things would make you perfect at them too. </li><li>Jay Shetty explains how you're stressed when your mind is not aligned with your actions. When you're doing something but you're unsure if it's right or when you hate your job or education but you still do it. A clear image of what you want from your life in the next week or the next decade helps you align your actions with your thoughts. <strong><em>Eliminate stress</em></strong><em>.</em></li><li>Most importantly, it gives you the strength to stand alone. When you dare to differ, you're going to doubt yourself every day when you see everyone else taking the other road. When you walk on a path where others don't, you need to know where you're going. <strong><em>Seek clarity.</em></strong></li></ol><h3 id="okay-so-how-does-it-work">OKAY, SO HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3><p>The Bible as well as One republic (in the song counting stars) say <em>"seek it out and ye shall find" </em>and it is as simple as that.</p><p>We see ads every day on social media, on roads and almost everywhere. But can you recall the ads you see? We browse through Facebook to get updates on our friends and family so we blur out whatever isn't about them. But remember that time when you were thinking of getting a new pair of shoes or headphones and an ad shows up right on your feed and you can't help but notice? Even when you're not looking for it, the subconscious clarity your brain has on what you want makes you see that ad. When you define a crystal clear image of what you want from your life even in the near future, everything else blurs.</p><p>We've heard about the law of attraction, a belief that positive thoughts attract positive things and people in life. But maybe we all have positive and negative things around us all the time, and only when we have the clarity of what we want and we choose to focus on the positive, we stop seeing the negatives and see the positives everywhere!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2021/10/IE-clarity-simplicity-same-cover.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><hr><h3 id="how-do-i-seek-clarity-like-the-pros">HOW DO I SEEK CLARITY LIKE THE PROS? </h3><p>Seeking clarity is an active process that requires you to put in the time to get the return. A high performer spends 74 more mins a week deliberately seeking clarity on different aspects of life than an average person. </p><p>Where you can go wrong while seeking clarity is when you emphasize too much on the answers. <strong>Be obsessed with finding the right questions</strong>. When you have the right questions you'll find the answers eventually. Clarity starts with the right questions.<br>Set apart some time daily or weekly to reflect on the work you do, the way you interact with people, the good and bad habits, document everything. Write it down or record voice notes. <strong>Study yourself</strong> like you would study someone before hiring them.</p><p>Ask yourself :<br>1.  Who am I? What are my strengths and weaknesses<br>2.  What are my values in life?<br>3.  What are my future aspirations? What current things that I do are steps towards it?<br>4.  If I could describe my ideal self in the future, the person I'm trying to become how would I describe him/her?  <br>5.  Am I of service to people?</p><p>Questions like what are my future aspirations and what do I want with life can be intimidating at first. Take small steps, list the things you like, the things you're good at, the things you want to be good at. Find an intersection, no matter how absurd it sounds it's possible, it's the 21st century. Ignore the naysayers.</p><p>You can go as deep with the questions as your mind goes and there's no right or wrong. It can be scary because you're going to be vulnerable, you're going to have the same experience you had when it was time to raise your hand in class to ask a doubt, but we know it's the only way to learn. The only thing to be scared of is ending up somewhere wrong just because we were too busy or scared to ask.</p><blockquote><strong>Clear thinking requires courage rather than intelligence. ~ Thomas Szasz</strong></blockquote><p>Ask yourself questions about the 4 important aspects of life: <strong>Self, Social, Skill and Service</strong>. The 4-S of clarity.</p><p>Don't worry about getting all 4 perfectly at once. Every one of us has at least one of the four aspects under control, which makes it easier to have clarity on it. One by one we put all 4 pieces together.</p><p>Remember that nowhere does it say the habit is getting clarity because getting to the end of it is not the goal, just actively seeking it does the work. It's about progress, not perfection. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2021/10/1_cDBKxgRD30TjEgDe0g877A.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="570" height="379"></figure><hr><h3 id="the-warren-buffet-way">THE WARREN BUFFET WAY</h3><p>Take a notebook and list down 25 of the most important things that you value in your life. Done? Now make sure you rank them in the order of importance. Then finally, scrape off the bottom 20 from the list. Yes, remove them from the list and your life at once. <br><br><strong>You have to realise that the bottom 20 are draining your energy and time that you need to assign to the top 5 important things in your life</strong>. These 20 although important, aren't important enough that's why they're below the top 5. Things like social media have a bad reputation already. Anyone who wastes time on social media knows he/she is wasting their time. But these sneaky 20 things give you a sense of false productivity because they are important but they're taking away time from the top 5 things that could revolutionise your life and that is exactly why they're so dangerous. <br></p><h3 id="take-action-now">TAKE ACTION NOW.</h3><p>Just thinking never works. Writing down what you came up with is the best way to solidify it in your head. <strong>Journalling</strong> is one of the best things you can do to seek clarity.</p><blockquote><strong>Clarity comes from action not thoughts ~ Marie Forleo</strong></blockquote><p>Once you have the clarity of values, of yourself and everything in between, compress it into words and expression. </p><p>• Find quotes that resonate.<br>• Write it down big and bold on a whiteboard<br>• Write it on a big piece of paper and stick it on the wall or on a sticky note and 	      stick it to your mirror.</p><p> Do whatever it takes to keep it in your sight. Get familiar with yourself. This is not a motivational youtube video that fires you up for a day and then long lost forever. </p><blockquote><strong>You can't be what you can't see. ~ Marian Wright Edelman</strong></blockquote><h3 id="the-biggest-enemies-to-clarity">THE BIGGEST ENEMIES TO CLARITY</h3><p><strong>Asking the wrong questions can lead down the wrong path</strong>. Why don't I fit in? Why don't I have what he has? Why do I suck? What's wrong with me? These are the questions that make things worse. Avoid them.</p><p>"I like being spontaneous" is an excuse you might want to give yourself. But the ability to think and foresee is what makes us human. A balance of spontaneity and clarity makes life better.</p><p>You're never too busy for yourself. If you can't take out 60 mins in a week for navigating your ship of life to the direction you want to go in, you'll always be pushed around by the currents. You've made it to the end of the post so I'm sure you're going to be a true seeker.</p><blockquote><strong>If you don't have time for the small things, you won't have time for the big things. ~Sir Richard Branson</strong></blockquote><p><em>Thanks for reading :)</em></p></div>
